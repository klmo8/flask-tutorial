Although I am already familiar with Django, I want to learn Flask so that I can better understand some of the "magic" going on behind the scenes with Django. Also, the focus of my next personal project will be developing JS skills and using a front-end framework for the first time, so I want to have something very lightweight and flexible on the backend.
