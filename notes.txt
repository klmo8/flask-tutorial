GET vs POST:
- GET submits form data through the address bar while POST submits form fields through the body of the request

Why SQLAlchelmy:
- it is an ORM, which means that it allows us to abstract away all the SQL commands and tables into higher level syntax and construct (ie: classes, methods)

SQLite vs MySQL and others:
- use SQLite for small apps, especially in production
- stored in a single file on disk
- doesn't require a server to run (need to read up on this--how would we setup MySQL for this app?)
